SteerAudio
==========

SteerAudio is one of several iOS demo apps for the [Philadelphia Game Lab](http://www.philadelphiagamelab.org)'s open source 3D Audio library, [Sonic](https://github.com/philadelphiagamelab/Sonic). As with all Sonic apps, SteerAudio requires headphones.

SteerAudio uses gyroscope input to shape a sound. Specifically, as the user turns, the sound is adjusted accordingly to create the illusion that the sound is eminating from a particular point in the room.
